FaceClassifier
==============

No trained model for face search

The file just enlists the histogram correlation between the face in the input image and the photos in the image directory.

Steps :-
1. Download the code.
2. Setup OpenCV based on the type of your OS (For MacOS, I would recommend using MacPorts)
3. Setup user header search paths(location of opencv header files. I use /opt/local/include)
4. Change path of Haar classifier xml file in the global variables section.
5. Provide the image directory path and the input image path in the main function.

Enjoy.... 

Feedback is welcome. :)
